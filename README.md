Hi, Iâ€™m @fresnel.alexander, a dominican guy studying coding & programming, some things that I like are programming (Obviously), music, art, origami, videogames, writing, and overall creative things.
I'm currently learning C, but am interested on Python, Javascript (And CSS/HTML), C++, C#, Rust, Java, and some other languages, apart from coding, I'm also learning Japanese, French and Portuguese, I also know English (Duh...) and Spanish.
If you try to reach me I will probably be studying or playing something
